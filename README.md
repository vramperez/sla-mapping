# SLA

Associated repository to the paper *From SLA to vendor-neutral metrics: An intelligent knowledge-based approach for multi-cloud SLA-based broker* published in [International Journal Of Intelligent Systems](https://doi.org/10.1002/int.22638) containing data, and scripts for analysis and figures.

We presents a solution to the problem of automatically translating SLAs into objectives expressed as metrics that can be measured across multiple cloud providers. First, we propose an intelligent knowledge-based system capable of automatically translating high-level SLAs (Service-Level Agreement) defined by cloud consumers into a set of conditions expressed as vendor-neutral metrics, providing feedback to cloud consumers (intelligent tutoring system). Secondly, we present the set of vendor-neutral metrics and explain how they can be measured for the different cloud providers. Finally, we report a validation based on two use cases (IaaS and PaaS) in a multi-cloud environment formed by leading cloud providers. This evaluation has demonstrated that, thanks to the complementarity of the two solutions, cloud consumers can automatically and transparently exploit the multi-cloud in many application domains, as endorsed by the cloud experts consulted in the course of this study.
